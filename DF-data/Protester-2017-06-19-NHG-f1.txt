Instructions: Highlight text describing the setting and all the actions of a protester-initiated event occurring during the Occupy movement. If more than one event is described, be sure to adjust the highlight flag indicating which text corresponds with which event. Remember, a protester-imitated event is one that protesters plan or lead, AND that is not in direct immediate response to an event initiated by the police/government. Many protester activities occur during events that police initiate, and those protester activities should be highlighted as a part of a POLICE-initiated event.
