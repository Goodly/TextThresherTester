Instructions: Highlight text that gives information about actions or statements from a civilian government (like the City of State) during the Occupy movement. If the article describes multiple distinct actions, be sure to adjust the number on the highlight flag indicating which text corresponds with which action. Remember, a government action or event is one that civilian government officials lead, AND that is not primarily a police action.
